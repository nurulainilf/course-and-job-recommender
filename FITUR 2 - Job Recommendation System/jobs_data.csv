Marketing & Social Media,Brand Manager,Tentang Anak,Penuh waktu,Hybrid • Jakarta,Min. 4 years of experience,Negotiable,https://dealls.com/loker/brand-manager-31~tentang-anak,"About The Role
Tentang Anak is on a mission to help 80 million children in Indonesia grow up healthier, happier, and better supported. We do this by building trusted products across multiple categories, from nutrition and skincare to children's intellectual property (books, play kits, educational tools, and more).
While we are proud of how far we’ve come, we believe that building a lasting brand means continuously improving every product and experience we offer. For this reason, we are looking for Business Owners to take full ownership of each of our core consumer verticals: Nutrition, Skincare, or Children’s IP Products.
You will not be responsible for all three, you will focus on one vertical only, selected based on your personal strengths, interest, and fit with the business. You will work alongside other vertical owners and report directly to the leadership team. This is a rare opportunity to take full ownership of a high-potential business inside a mission-led, fast-growing brand.
What This Role Is (and Is Not)
This is a business leadership role, designed for someone who can take full end-to-end responsibility for making a vertical succeed.
You will drive cross-functional execution, and be accountable for your vertical’s P&L, product portfolio, channel performance, and consumer retention. You will work closely with the Head of Brand and CEO to build your business in a way that is both strategically sound and operationally realistic.
We are open to candidates from any industry. You do not need an FMCG background. What matters most is your ability to think clearly, move quickly, work collaboratively, and care deeply about product quality and customer trust.
This is a true P&L ownership role, not a brand marketing position. You will shape product direction, pricing, GTM strategy, retention, and execution plans, with full accountability for performance. We’ll support you with tools and expertise, but the business outcomes are yours to lead.
We’re open to candidates from outside FMCG. You might come from startups, consumer tech, DTC, education, retail, or media. What matters is your clarity of thinking, business instincts, and ability to lead cross-functional work.
What You Will Own
You will act as the Business Owner of your vertical:
What Success Looks Like (6–12 Months)
Why Join Tentang Anak","You’re passionate about one of our verticals (nutrition, skincare, or IP content)
You’re not just strategic, you also get things done and solve problems proactively
You’re comfortable with numbers, trade-offs, and fast iterations
You balance business logic and good taste, you care about how products perform and feel
You value humility, ownership, and clarity in how you lead","Medical Insurance
