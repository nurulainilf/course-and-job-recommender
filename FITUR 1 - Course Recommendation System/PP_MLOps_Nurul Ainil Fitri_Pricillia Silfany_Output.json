In the first section of this course, we will focus on how to navigate in a Linux environment using only the CLI. We will explain how to create files, directories, and the commands you need to manage your system. We will also discover how to set permissions in the environment as well as edit text and configuration files.\nIn the second section, we'll go a bit deeper into the CLI and learn about troubleshooting tools that we have available to us. You'll see how to test networking connectivity as well as install and configure Linux applications.\n\nThe third portion of this course will focus on network troubleshooting in AWS. We'll discover the common ports that can cause problems when setting up security groups and network access control lists (NACLs).

Week 1 closes with automation with scripting by sharing examples of how automation helps and the benefits of using scripts. A focus on Automation isn't complete with an overview of Infrastructure as Code. You'll get introduced to Provisioning and Configuration Management and solve an automation problem with AWS CloudFormation. The instructors will then share some simple automation examples and how various tools can help you get the job done.

We will start with some review of previous topics covered in the series, with specific attention paid towards debugging and troubleshooting. We'll then move into concepts around interacting with customers to obtain information and progress towards a solution.\nIn the next module, you'll have the opportunity to view the architecture from various perspectives, such as builder, supporter, and interviewer. We will then shift into preparing you to apply for Cloud Support Associate positions. This will involve diving into resume and portfolio building, as well as the creation of an online presence. The second module will close out with a look at how you can evaluate opportunities and any gaps you may have in your knowledge. The third module of the course will have a focus on interviewing. This will involve preparing for interviews, discussions with professions from AWS Premium Support around the interviewing and hiring process, and looking at mock interviews and sample questions. The last module of the course will allow you to practice using the knowledge and various skills you've acquired over the course of the series with a multi-part project. In the project, you'll build, analyze, and document an application architecture. You'll also can view the architecture from various perspectives, such as builder, supporter, and interviewer."
